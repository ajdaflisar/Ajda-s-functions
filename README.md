# Ajda-s-functions
This is a repository with two functions: remind_me and cheat

Tryout my remind_me function:

remind_me()

It serves as a reminder for your friends' birthdays in December!

Tryout my cheat function: 

cheat("3.1.1") 
This gives you the correct answer for the first exercise in the programming assignment for week 3!
